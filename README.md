# LivingstonFC :soccer:

Livingston FC is an iOS App that displays information about the Club, league table, most recent games and player stats.

It was built as a part of my Graded Unit project at college. I have created every part of the app myself.

The content is provided by my own RESTful API - Livingson FC API, and BBC Sport News API.

###### The libraries used:
- Alamofire 4.7
- SwiftyJSON 4.0
- JSONWebToken
